# Elementary-Cellular-Automaton

A Windows Form Application for generating cellular automaton according to the rule: 60,90,120,150.

Elementary cellular automaton is a mathematics and computability theory, an elementary cellular automaton is a one-dimensional cellular automaton where there are two possible states (labeled 0 and 1) and the rule to determine the state of a cell in the next generation depends only on the current state of the cell and its two immediate neighbors.
